        <p>
          Dopin is a platform for discovering, sharing, and creating local
          Dopins (user-generated events and activities). Users are solely
          responsible for the accuracy, legality, and safety of their shared
          content.
        </p>
        <p>
          Dopin LLC does not organize, host, or sponsor any events unless
          explicitly stated.

          10. Limitation of Liability
        </h2>
        <p>
          We do our best to keep Dopin safe and reliable, but sometimes things

          because of other users’ actions.

        <p>
          We may suspend or terminate your account if we believe you’ve violated
          these Terms, engaged in illegal activity, or endangered others. You
          may delete your account anytime in your settings.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-3">
          After termination, your rights to use Dopin end immediately.
