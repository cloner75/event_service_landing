        </p>
        <p className="mt-3">

          1. Be Respectful
          <p>
            We celebrate individuality and diversity. Treat everyone with
            kindness and respect.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-3 space-y-1">
            <li>No harassment, bullying, threats, or hate speech.</li>
            <li>
              No discrimination based on race, gender, age, religion,
              nationality, or personal identity.
            </li>
            <li>
              Personal attacks, insults, or degrading comments are not tolerated
              — in chats, Dopins, or anywhere in the app.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>

        <section>
          2. Share Real and Factual Information
          <p>
            Dopin thrives on trustworthy event information and genuine
            experiences. Only share accurate details about events or Dopins you
            create.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-3 space-y-1">
            <li>Do not post misleading or fake event data.</li>
            <li>Avoid rumors, impersonation, or deceptive content.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-3">
            We encourage reporting any false or suspicious activities to keep
            the platform reliable.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          3. Protect Privacy — Yours and Others’
          <p>
            Respect everyone’s right to privacy. Never share private messages,
            phone numbers, addresses, or personal info of others without
            consent.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-3 space-y-1">
            <li>Do not publish screenshots or private conversations.</li>
            <li>
              Avoid asking for unnecessary personal details in Dopins or chats.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-3">
            Dopin may take down content that exposes personal information or
            compromises user safety.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          4. Keep It Safe
          <p>Safety always comes first. Plan and attend Dopins responsibly.</p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-3 space-y-1">
            <li>Illegal or unsafe activities are strictly forbidden.</li>
            <li>Users are responsible for their own safety.</li>
            <li>Do not promote or participate in violence, drugs, or crime.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-3">
            If you feel unsafe or see concerning activity, report it immediately
            through the app.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          5. Respect Intellectual Property
          <p>
            Share only what you have rights to. Do not post copyrighted images,
            event descriptions, or other protected materials.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3">
            Use your own photos, visuals, and words whenever possible. If you
            reference public data, ensure it’s factual and not copyrighted.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-3">
            Repeated copyright violations may lead to permanent account removal.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          6. Keep Dopin Spam-Free
          <p>
            Dopin is for real connections — not advertising or spam. No mass
            messages, fake promotions, or irrelevant links.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-3 space-y-1">
            <li>No self-promotion or unrelated marketing.</li>
            <li>
              Do not use Dopin to collect data, conduct surveys, or sell
              products.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-3">
            We want Dopin to stay authentic, local, and people-focused.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          7. Stay Authentic
          <p>
            Your account should reflect the real you. One account per person.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-3 space-y-1">
            <li>No fake identities or impersonating others.</li>
            <li>Do not use bots, automation, or fake engagement tools.</li>
          </ul>
          <p className="mt-3">
            Authenticity builds trust — and trust builds community.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section>
          8. Sensitive and Mature Content
          <p>
            Dopin is an 18+ community, but all content must remain appropriate
            and respectful.
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mt-3 space-y-1">
            <li>No sexually explicit or pornographic content.</li>
            <li>No graphic violence or hate-based material.</li>
            <li>
              Event-related artistic nudity must follow decency standards and
              legal limits.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
