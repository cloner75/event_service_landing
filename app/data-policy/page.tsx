      <p className="font-semibold  ">
        Effective Date: November 2025
      </p>

      <p>
        This Data Policy explains how Dopin LLC (“Dopin,” “we,” “our,” or “us”)
        collects, processes, stores, and protects user data while providing our
        mobile application, website, and related services (“Service”). It
        complements our Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.
      </p>

      <p className="font-semibold  ">1. Purpose</p>
      <p>
        Dopin processes data only to provide a safe, personalized, and reliable
        platform for event discovery, Dopins (user-generated meetups), and
        community communication. We are committed to transparency, security, and
        user control in every aspect of data handling.
      </p>

      <p className="font-semibold  ">2. Types of Data Processed</p>
      <p>Dopin processes the following categories of data:</p>

      <p className="font-medium  ">a. Account Data</p>
      <p>
        We collect your phone number, username, and password to verify your
        account and secure access to the Service.
      </p>

      <p className="font-medium  ">b. Optional Profile Data</p>
      <p>
        To help personalize your Dopin experience, you may optionally provide:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>Industry or field of work</li>
        <li>Education level</li>
        <li>Job title or role</li>
        <li>Languages spoken</li>
        <li>Home city or location</li>
        <li>Relationship status (Single, In a Relationship, Married)</li>
        <li>Gender (Male, Female, Non-binary, Prefer not to say)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Providing this information is entirely optional and can be edited or
        deleted anytime from your profile. We use it only to improve
        personalization — such as showing relevant events, Dopins, or community
        recommendations — never for advertising, profiling, or selling user
        data.
      </p>

      <p className="font-medium  ">c. User Activity Data</p>
      <p>
        This includes Dopins you create, join, or interact with; chat messages;
        and factual event submissions (titles, dates, and locations).
      </p>

      <p className="font-medium  ">d. Technical and System Data</p>
      <p>
        We collect device information, IP address, app version, and general
        location (if enabled) to secure and optimize the Service.
      </p>

      <p className="font-semibold  ">3. Data Ownership</p>
      <p>
        You remain the owner of your personal and optional profile data. Dopin
        processes this data only to provide app functionality and personalize
        experiences in a privacy-respecting way. Optional fields do not affect
        your ability to use Dopin’s core features and may be removed at any
        time.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not claim ownership of user-submitted Dopins, event information,
        or messages.
      </p>

      <p className="font-semibold  ">
        4. Data Storage and Retention
      </p>
      <p className="font-medium  ">a. Storage Duration</p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">

        </li>
        <li>User data: retained as long as your account remains active.</li>
        <li>
          Deleted accounts: identifying information (phone, username, and

          operational safety, fraud detection, and analytics.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p className="font-medium  ">b. Data Location</p>

      <p className="font-semibold  ">5. Data Security</p>
      <p>
        Dopin applies strong security measures to protect user data from
        unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or loss. Our safeguards
        include:

        <li>Limited employee access under confidentiality agreements.</li>
        <li>Continuous system monitoring and periodic security audits.</li>

      <p>
        We also maintain incident response procedures in compliance with U.S.
        and international privacy laws.
      </p>

      <p className="font-semibold  ">6. Data Access and Control</p>
      <p>
        Users can access and manage their data within the app settings. You may

        <li>Correction or deletion of your personal information.</li>
        <li>Limitation of certain data uses (e.g., location tracking).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Requests are verified and processed through{" "}

        within a reasonable timeframe.
      </p>

      <p className="font-semibold  ">7. Data Sharing</p>
      <p>
        Dopin does not sell or trade user data. We only share data under the
        following conditions:
      </p>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>
          With trusted service providers for hosting, analytics, or security —
          under contractual confidentiality.
        </li>
        <li>If legally required by authorities.</li>
        <li>To protect user safety or prevent fraud.</li>
        <li>
          During a company restructuring, merger, or acquisition — under this
          same policy.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>We never share personal data for marketing or advertising purposes.</p>

      <p className="font-semibold  ">8. User Responsibility</p>
      <p>
        Users are responsible for maintaining account security by keeping
        passwords confidential and avoiding sharing private data in public
        Dopins or chats. Dopin cannot control the actions of other users who may
        access shared information.
      </p>

      <p className="font-semibold  ">9. Data Policy Updates</p>
      <p>
        We may update this Data Policy periodically to reflect legal,
        operational, or technological changes. If updates are significant, we
        will notify users through the app or website.

        Policy.
